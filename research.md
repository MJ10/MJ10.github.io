My research interests lie broadly in the area of Machine Learning. I am interested in developing algorithms for sequential decision making in complex environments. I am also interested in tackling more fundamental challenges of generalization, exploration, and sample complexity in deep reinforcement learning, and in the broader analysis and application of neural networks.
