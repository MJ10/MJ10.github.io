My research interests lie broadly in the area of Machine Learning. I am interested in developing algorithms for decision making in complex environments. More specifically this includes topics at the intersection of reinforcement learning, game theory and multi-agent systems. I am also interested in tackling more fundamental challenges of generalization and sample complexity in deep reinforcement learning. I am also interested in recurrent neural networks, generative adversarial networks and theoretical analysis of neural networks.
