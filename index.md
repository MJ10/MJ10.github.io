I am a final year undergraduate student pursuing my Bachelor's degree in Information Technology at the National Institute of Technology Karnataka, Surathkal.

I have been fortunate to collaborate with a number of amazing researchers in my brief experience. I spent the summer of 2019 at the [Machine Learning Lab](http://ml3.leuphana.de) at Leuphana University Luneburg working with [Prof. Ulf Brefeld](https://www.leuphana.de/en/institutes/iis/personen/ulf-brefeld.html) and [Dr. Uwe Dick](http://ml3.leuphana.de/uwe.html) working on inverse reinforcement learning. Following that, I spent a semester working on my undergraduate thesis with [Dr. Prateek Jain](http://www.prateekjain.org/) and [Dr. Harsha Vardhan Simhadri](http://harsha-simhadri.org/) at [Microsoft Research](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-india/) on efficient machine learning algorithms for inference on edge devices.

I also collaborate with the fantastic team [FOR.ai](https://for.ai) working on various topics ranging from large-scale neural network training to reinforcement learning.
