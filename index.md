I am a Research Intern at [MILA](https://mila.quebec/en/) working with [Prof. Yoshua Bengio](https://yoshuabengio.org/) on exploration in reinforcement learning, as part of the [LambdaZero](https://mila.quebec/en/ai-society/exascale-search-of-molecules/) project. I recently graduated from the [National Institute of Technology Karnataka, Surathkal](https://www.nitk.ac.in/) with a B. Tech. in Information Technology.

I have been fortunate to collaborate with a number of amazing researchers in my brief experience. I spent the summer of 2019 at the [Machine Learning Lab](http://ml3.leuphana.de) at Leuphana University Luneburg working with [Prof. Ulf Brefeld](https://www.leuphana.de/en/institutes/iis/personen/ulf-brefeld.html) and [Dr. Uwe Dick](http://ml3.leuphana.de/uwe.html) working on inverse reinforcement learning. Following that, I spent a semester working on my undergraduate thesis with [Dr. Prateek Jain](http://www.prateekjain.org/) and [Dr. Harsha Vardhan Simhadri](http://harsha-simhadri.org/) at [Microsoft Research](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-india/) on efficient machine learning algorithms for inference on edge devices. More recently I have also been collaborating with [Dr. Jakob Foerster](https://www.jakobfoerster.com/) of [Facebook AI](https://ai.facebook.com/)/[University of Toronto](https://web.cs.toronto.edu/) on model-based approaches in multi-agent reinforcement learning.

I also collaborate with the fantastic team [FOR.ai](https://for.ai) working on various topics ranging from large-scale neural network training to reinforcement learning.
